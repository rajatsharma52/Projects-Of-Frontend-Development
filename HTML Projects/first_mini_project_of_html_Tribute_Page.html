        <p>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer 
            of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control system Git. 
            Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he
